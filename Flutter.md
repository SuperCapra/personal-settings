# Flutter 101

Goes to flutter website https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/quick and follow the instruction, if `flutter --version` does not work in the terminal follow this instruction
1. `nano ~/.zshrc`
2. set `export PATH="$PATH:/Users/youruser/yourfolder/flutter/bin"` for me it's export `PATH="$PATH:/Users/gmaggi/Progetti/flutter/bin"`
3. `source ~/.zshrc`
